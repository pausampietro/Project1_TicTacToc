# Project1_TicTacToc

This project is about creating a playground to play the TicTacToc, which consists on:

1. 1 user plays against the computer to be the first in aligning three of it's figures (crosses or circles) in a 3x3 playground, initially empty.
2. Crosses are automatically asign to the user, and circles to the computer
3. The code choose randomly which player starts playing
4. On user's turn, he/she must give the coordinates X and Y where he/she wants to place the cross. 
5. On PC's turn, it randomly generate both coordinates X and Y to place the circle
6. On both cases, the program checks if it's an empty space, otherwise returns to point 4 or 5, respectively.
7. Once one player has aligned 3 figures, he/she/it win. 
8. If all the playground is full, there is a tie.

BONUS: After 3 figures of every player have been placed, the player or the computer have to choose which one take out to place the new one
